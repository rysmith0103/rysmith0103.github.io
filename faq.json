        "question": "What are the best practices for watering my lawn during a heatwave?",
        "answer": "During a heatwave, water your lawn deeply and less frequently—about twice a week—to encourage deep root growth. Watering early in the morning helps reduce evaporation and ensures the grass can absorb moisture efficiently. An irrigation system can be an effective way to automate this process and prevent under or over-watering.",
